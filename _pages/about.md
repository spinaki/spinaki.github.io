I’m Pinaki. This blog covers:

- Efficient LLM training (LoRA, quantization, KV-cache, speculative decoding)
- Alignment (RLHF, DPO, preference modeling)
- Evaluation (benchmarks, auto-evals, judges)
- Agentic systems and tool-using assistants
- Core math and statistics that underpin generative models.
